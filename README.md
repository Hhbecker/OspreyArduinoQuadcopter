#### Features:
* Automated PID stabilization for roll pitch and yaw axes 
* Joystick control of roll pitch and yaw axes 
* Joystick throttle mapped directly to motor speed
* Roughly 20Hz flight controller refresh rate

### Why Drones?
I find drones to be the perfect engineering challenge because they require knowledge from a range of disciplines including physics, electrical engineering, computer science, and math. 
This drone project also provided me experience developing embedded software for a real-time application, designing and constructing circuits and electrical hardware, and implementing an algorithm based on control theory mathematics. Not only are drones a great engineering challenge but they also have innumerous real world applications including in disaster relief, law enforcement, agriculture, and war.

### Code explanation 
The arduino runs a continuous loop with the same main functions called each time the loop executes.

### PID tuning 

### Next Steps:
* add altitude control 
* replace arduino uno with multiple arduino nanos
* redesign hardware to be more condensed and centralized on drone frame
